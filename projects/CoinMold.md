Around the summer of 2022 I really got into these youtube videos where people would go into junkyards, find appliances, and strip them of as much metal as possible. There was this real powerful feeling of heating up something so hot it melts and you make it into something of your own. I've been really into manufacturing for a while, my favorite being additive manufacturing otherwise known as 3d printing. I've researched and look into metallic 3d printers for a while but they're all quite expensive and use special metallic powders that are very dangerous to breath in. So I researched and came up with multiple possible ways each with their own pros and cons.

The first way was to apply multiple layers of a very high temperature resistant coating, mixed with metal wires wrapped around it kind of acting like rebar in concrete. You'd add a spout to your design beforehand that would be coated as well, except for the very top portion. Lots of layers and drying later you're left with a very high resistant and strong mold, only problem is there's a 3d print inside it and if it's at all intricate then there's no way of physically pulling it out without breaking your solid coating. The answer is to hang in a furnace with the spout down and increasing the temperature to 285+ degrees Celcius will result in the 3d print turning into a liquid and flowing out. Then you take out the hot mold which is just a negative of whatever print was inside and pour in your molten metal. The issues that I found with this method is that there's a lot of downtime since you need to wait 30 minutes to an hour for the coating to dry before you can apply a new one. As well, the heat resistant coating would often crack and leak out the molten metal due to the heat shock. Lastly taking out the mold requires a tedious process of taking apart the layers of coating and metal which can also take a long time.
