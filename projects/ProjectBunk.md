This was a personal project of mine I did in 2020. At the peak of the pandemic I found myself with lots of time on my hands, and also a very cramped room. It fit a small desk and a bed with barely any walking space. So one night I started making a very rough design for bunk bed on fusion 360. I knew nothing about standard wood sizes so I began researching about wood sizes, prices, and general strength. It was very interesting to learn how 2 by 4's are actually 1.5 by 3.5 inches and that this pattern was very consistent across every wood size. From there I measured my room and thought of all the different combinations to explore. There really wasn't many viable orientations since my room is shaped like a reverse Z tetris block. So once I had all the measurements I needed and had a rough idea of what I wanted to gain from the bunkbed I moved to fusion 360 and began designing.
