### I. Introduction
AI is a rapdily evolving technology achieving incredible things in the creative sector and a overall proving to be another tool to be used in Education. In specific to Software Engineering it's a helpful tool used in different forms, such as github co-pilot. Personally I've used it to solve recurring problems or creating certain functions, to optimize already existing code with some success, and also to provide some creative feedback on how a webpage could be structured or giving team names and images. All using Chat-gpt and its image generator as well.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

1. Experience WODs, usually take home WODS I very rarely used AI, if anything just for helping me with a certain function or giving me format for a style.css file. To start me off and I add from there.

2. In-class Practice WODs, I really tried not to use it as much as possible. These definitely were my time to focus on applying myself to learn the course work. At times I would try to solve in-class WODS using chat-gpt and try to reverse engineer it to teach myself but this method isn't efficient and we're given tools to succeed so I quickly stopped.

3. In-class WODs, plenty of WODS are example problems that have been solved so chat-gpt has a simple time solving these in the beginning. It really saved me one time as my computer was giving me technical issues and I spent lots of time trying to figure it out, until I finally opted to use my phone and chat-gpt the solution as a desperate attempt to save my points. Plugging into a Javascript webpage and showing it worked.

4. Essays in this class I enjoyed writing. The focus on making it interesting and giving our essays our own flavor is very appealing to me as I often feel tied down in other classes. So being able to give my thoughts in my own metaphors and creative ways was a nice change of pace. That's why I believe I only used AI once when I was close on time to submit my essay.

5. Final project, I only used AI to come give inspirations on web page design in the very early stages.

6. Learning a concept sometimes I'd use AI to understand a topic in greater detail or sometimes just a big picture. I found that rarely using it to reverse engineer understanding code was very innefficient and prefered to just follow videos.

7. Answering a question in class or in Discord sometimes I'd use AI as a second opinion in a question, but never as the final answer as I don't trust it to understand my context in software engineering.

8. Asking or answering a smart-question, no I did not use AI to ask or answer a smart question. First I don't think I'm in a position to answer any question if I need to use AI to answer it. Also asking was unnceccessary as we were given clear instructions on the format of a smart question and giving all the necessary info to make a good prompt I might as well just make the question myself.

9. Coding examples were useful for understanding how to use a function in the correct way. But going back to learning a concept using AI. It's not the most efficient but it's worth a shot when stuck in a bind.

10. Explaining code was one of the most useful points of AI. Although it has a hard time producing good code, it can explain good code very well when it's used in the prompt. This doesn't mean it can build on it easily but just a good learning tool.

11. For Writing Code kind of as mentioned before. Even with good code as a prompt it has a hard time build on pre existing code. I found it easier to ask it to solve the whole problem and take the pieces i'm interested in and adapt it for my code.

12. Documenting code I didn't document code as much as I should've and code generated by AI generally comes with good inline documentation which is what makes it helpful to learn off of.

13. Quality assurance, I never used it this way but I could see how it could work. AI in my experience can reliably make code more efficient, but it does break it sort of often so it's still just a tool to use not a be all end all.

14. Used for fun to generate images.


### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
AI has influence my learning experience greatly. It's definitely made life easier but I can't disupute the fact that it makes me understand the topic less then I would of otherwise. It's a very helpful tool for me to manage lots of classes at once. I had 18 credits the semester I'm writing this and without it I would not have been able to stay afloat. Trying to balance all my other classes, being the captain/player of the UH Esports Overwatch team, and trying to have a social life having something like chatgpt is very helpful. So although I still feel I got a lot out of this class and learned lots of valuable new skills, I can't help but wonder what could've been in the reality where chatgpt doesn't exist and I have to just apply myself further and truly understand the course material at a level I could bring into a work environment or confidently create websites on my own.

### IV. Practical Applications:
AI in the professional setting being practical and useful is a difficult question. For the most part, I'd say those that you really don't need it. Project management tools exist, for creating code, it's better for the person within a company who has experience working there to design according to company needs and wants. Although github co-pilot is definitely a professional level tool. When you know exactly what you're looking for and it can be used to finish your sentences then it's very practical and a necessary tool. Just if you're not well experienced and not sure what you're doing it can quickly lead you down the wrong path and down an incorrect rabbit hole that's hard to get out of.

### V. Challenges and Opportunities:
AI is challenging to use because it's got a lot of faults. It does a poor job modifiying existing code. Adding a function and implementing it correctly. It tends to get names incorrect, and it can be time consuming to give it all the necessary information. Sometimes it won't remember information given a couple questions ago and start making things up. Still I think that if AI can be implemented in a way that can stay up to date with all the files and be able to relate the different files together then ultimately it could have a chance to be a lot more efficient and reliable. At the moment most AI tools simply don't function at that high of a level and after inputting over 50 lines of code it feels like it gets lazy in implementation or simply tells you it's to complex for the AI to handle. Lots of these are web browser AI tools so I think a standalone app or plugin might have better chance.

### VI. Comparative Analysis:
As a comparison between traditional teaching methods vs AI-enhanced approaches, I think that AI will eventually have a place in teaching. An AI tool tailored to teaching could have incredible potential the way things stand it's difficult to implement. AI just makes things very easy for things that turn out to be relatively simple. Which definitely hurts practical skill development. When students go to AI and get answers for the easy stuff, they think they shouldn't bother really learning it and found a convenient loop hole. In reality it can solve the simple questions but once it gets more complex, AI really begins to struggle, and telling a student to go back and learn material from weeks ago doesn't end well. Many times students would rather struggle through the hard problem trying to find pattern recognition to learn problems without ever understanding the fundamentals. Due to this knowledge retention, knowledge applicability, practical skill development, and engagement all suffer as a result. So as it stands AI is definitely causing more harm then good, but as a tool to help individual students I see the potential for AI to be more good. Compared to tradional learning methods when AI wasn't around I believe students realized they had to apply themselves more to compete with their peers. Now when peers see others cruising easily through certain portions using AI, and they're struggling through it. It can be very disheartening for the one trying to learn, although he will be the one benefiting in the long run.

### VII. Future Considerations:
As mentioned before, I think AI has the potential to be used in education. I think that there's a model of AI driven classroom that can help professors find what the general classroom is having the hardest time with. Or helping identify students using AI to inform them of the long term consequences of relying to heavily on AI. One possible advancement or an area of focus could be a larger focus on explanation for people that decide to use AI. An option they can opt into that won't just give the answer immediately but actually put it in parts that explains it and lets people put it together themselves with AI assisting them as they go.

### VIII. Conclusion:
To summarize what I've been talking about, my personal experience with AI is rocky but still useful. Although I use it, I don't necessarily agree that it's for everyone and I agree it's an easy way out. It has lots of flaws that end up making more of a mess then it's worth at times. As long as you know this though it can be a good second opinion or a good starting point, nothing more. It's undeniable that it's rapidly evolving and I believe it'll reach a point where its usefulness is undeniable but it will still require user discipline to make the most of it. Traditional methods might always be better, in the circumstance where you have a very competent professor that can handle lots of students. Though the fact is not all professors are that applied and this could benefit those students that seek more guidance. The way AI is allowed in this course helped me reach this conclusion and I think it works for me. The choice also helped other realize early the limitations and probably try to apply themselves further due to the transparency.
