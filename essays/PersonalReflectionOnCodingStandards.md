## Abstract
  The use of ESLint, and the broader topic of coding standards, is crucial for software engineering. This essay aims to explore the significance of ESLint within the software development, while also highlighting my personal experience in using it, and frustrating aspects.

## 1. Importance of Coding Standards
  At its core, ESLint is a tool, it's a standard of code quality and consistency. It enforces a set of rules that aim to prevent common mistakes, enforce style guidelines, and making code more legible for other engineers. This is the crucial aspect of software development, the need for maintainable, understandable, and robust code. In environments where multiple developers collaborate, ESLint serves as an impartial arbiter, ensuring that everyone adheres to a common standard.

## 2. My Experience
  Now that we're past the importance of Coding standards and ESLint, let's get into my personal experience. I'll start with honesty, I haven't worked with multiple developers on a single project yet. Still that being the case, I don't particulary find ESLint disturbing, and think that it's good practice for me to get experience with ESLint now and be able to show off code that might be more legible to those used to ESLint, then thinking I'll be able to always hold myself accountable to be consistent and the most legible. The simpler solution seems to be, just use ESLint or follow some standard, use it as a tool but it doesn't need to be the be all end all in my code. I have no problem ignoring a very small percentage of ESLint suggestions and doing it my way. For the most part though, I think it's a great tool.

## 3. Making ESLint Happy
  As I explained before, making ESLint happy is something I strive to do. At times though I opt to do things my way or simply what I deem does look better. Although these cases are few and far betweeen I think it's important to be able to also develop some of your own style. I don't think the ESLint suggestions up to this point have stopped me from achieving this.
