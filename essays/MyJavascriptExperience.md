## Starting Out
JavaScript has been the simplest of all languages to learn. Following the Free Code Camp tutorial, it quickly became apparent that this would be an easier language to learn with intuitive features. Something as simple as defining variables is much easier in JavaScript compared to any other language I've had the pleasure of learning at a surface level. Now, going back to other programming languages in other classes, I find myself missing the let keyword.

## Past Experiences

It's still not clear to me if JavaScript is just simpler and easier to learn because of its more lax and seemingly intuitive design, or perhaps because I've often struggled with other languages, that with every new language I manage to pick it up quicker and quicker. Regardless, the relative ease that came with picking up JavaScript for a surface-level understanding really makes me want to continue learning and expanding upon this knowledge and seeing what I can discover.

To give credit where it's due, the structure of the WODs, Free Code Camp, and the enthusiasm of my instructor play a key role in my desire to learn, improve, and welcome this challenge. This skill and the professionalism that accompanies it make me feel like I'm getting a lot out of this class and I should really try my best and follow as much as possible.

## Javascript for software engineering

Software engineering revolves around teamwork. One must be able to communicate and work well in a team to succeed in software development. This is for a multitude of reasons, but there's simply just a lot of nuance and things to do as a software engineer that a language that is easy to read and overall simpler to understand makes for a great teamwork tool. Just the fact that functions in JavaScript are first-class gives any software engineer a leg up in making code easy to read.

Another important fact about JavaScript is its compatibility with all modern web browsers. Its versatility is why any good software engineer is expected to have proficiency in JavaScript. That isn't to say JavaScript should be your only tool, but one of many to learn. JavaScript programmers can also adopt new language features immediately and don't need to wait for standards or new releases.

Possible disadvantages of JavaScript that I've found include the client-side structure making it more vulnerable to malicious attacks, but there are remedies for this. As well, its own flexibility to accommodate lots of different programming methods can lead to inconsistent coding practices among peers, which could negatively affect readability and consistency between files in a single project.

Regardless, JavaScript is an indispensable language to learn due to its native browser support, especially when it comes to web development. In other domains, such as desktop application development, it's definitely not that simple. Hence, context does matter, but for software engineering, it makes sense.

## The athletic teaching style

In a previous year, I took an algorithms course that was taught in a flipped classroom model. It didn't go well for me, due to a heavy workload from my extracurricular activities and school load, leading to bad practices and a hard time learning much. It very much focused on the idea of studying as much as possible and having questions to ask and learn about during the lecture. The athletic software engineering reminds me a lot of this class model, although it feels much better. It's still very early in the semester, but I've found that I enjoy learning in this class and am trying much harder than in the previous class. There are plenty of reasons for this motivation, as I mentioned before in my past experiences, but a key difference is the WODs and fun activities.

In the previous algorithms course, we were expected to learn everything from the textbook and understand and dissect it in homework. Although I'm sure a lot can be learned through a textbook, the fact of the matter is that for me personally, it overloads my brain quickly and like a sponge full of water, I have a very hard time intaking more information. This is a fault of my own that I should strive to improve. For some reason though, this class with its teaching style does empower my creativity and maybe the brutal honesty of how difficult it is lets me know I can't be lazy now. Hence, I'm thoroughly enjoying the current learning style and believe I will continue to enjoy it. I hope to learn a lot this semester and have something to show for it by the end.
