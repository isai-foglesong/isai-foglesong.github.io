## Starting Out
Javascript has been the most simple of all languages to learn. Following the Free Code Camp tutorial it was quickly apparent that this was gonna be a simpler language to learn with intuitive features. Something as simple as defining variables is much simpler in Javascript compared to any other language I've had the pleasure of learning at an surface level. Now going back to other programming languages in other classes, I find myself missing the Let keyword.

## Past Experiences

It's still not clear to me if Javascript is just simpler and easier to learn because its more lax and seemingly intuitive design, or perhaps because I've struggled with other languages very often, that with every new language I manage to pick it up quicker and quicker. Regardless the relative ease that came with picking up javascript for a surface level understanding, really makes me want to continue learning and expanding upon this knowledge and seeing what I can discover. 

To give credit where it's due, the structure of the WODs, the free code camp, and enthusiasm of my instructor play a key role in my desire to learn and improve and welcome this challenge. This skill and the professionalism that accompanies it, makes me feel like I'm getting a lot out of this class and I should really try my best and follow as much as possible.

## Javascript for software engineering

Software engineering revolves around teamwork. One must be able to communicate and work well in a team to succeed in software development. This is for multitude of reasons but there's simply just a lot of nuance and things to do as a software engineering that a language that is easy to read and all around simpler to understand makes for a great teamworking tool. Just the fact that functions in Javascript are first class, gives any software engineer a leg up in making easy to read code.

Another important fact about Javascript is its compatibility with all modern web browsers, its versatility is why any good software engineer is expected to have proficiency in Javascript. That isn't to say Javascript should be your only tool, but one of many to learn. Javascript programmers can also adopt new language features immediately and don't need to wait for standards or new releases.

Possible disadvantages of javascript that I've found is the client-side structure makes it more vulnerable to malicious attacks, but there is remedies for this. As well its own flexibility to lots of different programming methods can lead to inconsistent coding practices among peers which could have a negative affect on readability and consistency between files on a single project.

Regardless Javascript is an indispensable language to learn due to its native browser support, when it comes to web development. In other domains such as desktop application development, it's definitely not that simple. Hence context does matter but for software engineering it makes sense.

## The athletic teaching style



## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
